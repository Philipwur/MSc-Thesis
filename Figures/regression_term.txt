theta = 90
b' = 1

Last term takes 75 seconds to calculate (cycletime of 150s)
- extrapolation to intercept gets alpha of -11.067
- lattice of 123by123

Term 6 takes 16ms to calculate (cycletime of 0.031 seconds)
- extrapolation is 1.337% off best prediction
- lattice of 17by17

Term 11 takes 67ms to calculate (cycletime of 0.13 seconds)
- exterapolation is 0.497% off best prediction
- lattice of 27by27

we can itterate exactly to the error % we think is appropriate

maybe for the final graphs add in the intercept values within the legend box


for the theta = 60 example, the term 10-11 regression is larger, at 0.666%
